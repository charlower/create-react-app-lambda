                  <h3>How to protect yourself</h3>
                  <p>Password Security</p>
                  <p>
                    You should make sure that you keep your password secure. The
                    first step is choosing a secure password. In general, the
                    longer your password, the better and more secure it is. Your
                    password does not have to be just a single word, it can
                    contain spaces, numbers, punctuation, and Unicode characters
                    (I.E. non Latin characters including Chinese letters, etc.).
                    Therefore, you can use an entire phrase or sentence as your
                    password, or part of your password, to help make it as long
                    as possible. However, be careful not to use only dictionary
                    words, as this makes it easier for an attacker to guess.
                    Consider avoiding this by mixing up the cApiTalisATIOn,
                    adding digits3473, or ext,,ra p_unctua(tio%n [sic], for
                    example, or even including nonsense words that are not found
                    in any dictionary (or existing movie or literature).
                    However, making your password long is much more important
                    for security than making it look complicated with numbers
                    and capital letters, so consider using an entire sentence or
                    short paragraph as your password, but not one copied from a
                    book, a new one invented by yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avoid simple, common passwords like '12345', or,
                    'password',. Avoid using anything that an attacker would
                    easily be able to guess from context, including your name,
                    the websites name, your birthday or any other important date
                    in your life, the name of your pets, family, partner,
                    fictional characters, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Do not reuse passwords across multiple services - create a
                    new password for every service that requires one. Also, when
                    changing passwords, do not change to one that you have used
                    previously. Check{" "}
                    <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned </a>to
                    see if any of your existing accounts are known to be
                    compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ideally, you will be able to remember a long passphrase, but
                    if you are unable to, it is a better compromise to write
                    down your password somewhere secure, rather than to not
                    choose a secure password at all. If you do this, though,
                    make sure the password is *only* stored in a secure place
                    (your purse or wallet, perhaps). Do not write it on a sticky
                    note and store it permanently on or near your computer, for
                    example, especially if your computer is located in a shared
                    space like an office or family home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an alternative to trying to memorise long passwords (or
                    writing them down) for each website you use, you might
                    consider using a password manager. Password managers are
                    programs or browser plugins you can install which you
                    generating unique, secure passwords for every service you
                    use. It will encrypt these with a single password -- now the
                    only one that you have to remember. The disadvantage is that
                    you must now have a copy of your password file and password
                    manager on each computer which you need to login from.
                    Additionally, if you loose your password database (or your
                    computer crashes, etc.), you will not be able to login.{" "}
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers">
                      Wikipedia
                    </a>{" "}
                    Maintains a list of password managers for your comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avoid telling your password to other people. If multiple
                    people need to use the service, consider getting them to
                    create their own account instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avoid logging into the service from other peoples computers,
                    shared computers, and especially public computers (such as
                    at a school or library). Since many people use these
                    computers, their security is outside of your control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avoid logging into the service from a public place. If you
                    are using a mobile phone, for example, be very aware of what
                    is behind you. People may be looking over your shoulder, and
                    there might also be security cameras, mirrors, or other
                    reflective surfaces like windows or glasses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, regularly change your password; at least every 2 or
                    3 months for example. This will mean that even if your
                    password is compromised, the amount of time that an attacker
                    has to take control is limited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you follow all of these tips, your password will surely
                    remain secure!
