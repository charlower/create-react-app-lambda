                    Merchi respects your privacy. We will never rent or sell
                    your personal information to any third party for marketing
                    purposes. But we do need to use some of your information for
                    other purposes, and we created this Privacy Policy to make
                    sure you’re aware of what information we use and to help you
                    understand how and why we use this information. We also want
                    to be clear that by using this website you are consenting to
                    our collection, storage and use of your information as set
                    out in this Privacy Policy. We may need to update our
                    Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect our changing
                    business practices. We will publish any modified or updated
                    versions on our website.

                  <h3>The kinds of personal information we collect</h3>
                  <p>
                    To provide you with services across the Merchi platform we
                    need certain personal information. We need you to provide a
                    username and email address for us to give you access to some
                    parts of our website. You may also choose to provide
                    additional personal information, such as your full name,
                    location or address. Depending on the services you use, we
                    may also need you to provide other personal information,
                    such as your contact details, billing and payment
                    information and tax status. We also collect the content and
                    details of messages you send or receive via our network.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As a practice, we do not ask you to provide us with certain
                    sensitive personal information — that is, information about
                    your race, ethnicity, politics, religious or philosophical
                    beliefs, sexual preferences, health, or similar information.
                    If you share or post this information, for example by
                    mentioning it on your public profile or journal, or
                    including it in works you upload, we will collect it in the
                    sense that this information will be saved on our servers and
                    may become stored in our databases. We will treat this
                    sensitive information carefully, in the same way we treat
                    all personal information we collect.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We primarily collect information through our affiliate
                    websites, including through order purchases, sign-up forms,
                    surveys and transaction databases. We occasionally collect
                    information in person during research sessions. We also
                    collect information when you contact us, including through
                    email or our Facebook page, and through search
                    advertisements.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When you choose to connect your social media account to your
                    profile, we collect personal information from that social
                    media website. For example, when you connect your Facebook
                    account, we may collect the personal information you have
                    made publicly available in Facebook, such as your name,
                    profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friend
                    networks, age range, locale, friend list, and any other
                    information you have made public. We may also obtain other
                    non-public information from the social network website with
                    your permission.

                    store information either directly in log files and cookies,
                    or via third party vendors, including Google, Facebook, that

                    beacons. This information may include pages that you have
                    visited, your IP address, browser type and your operating
                    system. You can choose to disable cookies, but please
                    remember this may mean that parts of the website may not

                    <br />
                    We use third party vendors to display relevant ads for
                    Merchi or provide Merchi product recommendations at
                    locations away from our website on the Internet. Some of
                    these vendors, including Google and Facebook, use cookies to
                    display ads or provide Merchi product recommendations based
                    on your previous visits to the Merchi site. You can opt out
                    of the use of your information for online behavioral
                    advertising by NAI member companies by visiting the Network
                    Advertising Initiative opt-out page. You may also click here

                    <br />
                    The third party vendors we work with may collect information
                    about your online activities over time and on other websites
                    or applications.

                  <h3>How we use your personal information</h3>
                  <p>
                    We generally collect and use your personal information for
                    the purposes for which it was collected, like your username
                    and email address to provide access to certain functions on
                    our website, your banking and payment information to process
                    orders and payments, and information about your use of
                    Merchi to improve our website and for internal business
                    purposes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may use some of your personal information for market
                    research and marketing activities. We may send you
                    promotional messages and useful information about Merchi,
                    and these messages may be personalized based on your use of
                    Merchi and other personal information you have provided to
                    us. For example, we may let you know about interesting new
                    products based on your purchase history.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You can always opt out from receiving these types of
                    messages in your account settings or via the unsubscribe
                    link in marketing emails. You may still receive
                    administrative messages from us.

                  <h3>How we disclose your personal information</h3>
                  <p>
                    We may share your personal information with third party
                    service providers, including manufacturers and printers,
                    shipping and logistics companies, banks and payment
                    processing companies, email and web service providers, data
                    storage providers and market research firms.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We sometimes disclose personal information to service
                    providers located in the United States, Australia and the
                    United Kingdom. As we ship into over 50 countries, we may
                    disclose personal information to our shipping partners and
                    service providers in other countries as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may share information with governmental agencies or other
                    companies assisting us to prevent or investigate illegal
                    activity. If we believe in good faith that it is necessary
                    to do so, we may also share information to respond to legal
                    process (e.g., a court order or subpoena) to protect our
                    property and legal rights and those of our users or if
                    otherwise required by law. We may also disclose or otherwise
                    transfer personal information to an acquirer, successor, or
                    assignee of all or part of our business, including as a part
                    of any merger, acquisition, sale, or bankruptcy.

                  <h3>How we keep your information secure</h3>
                  <p>
                    While we take reasonable steps to keep your information
                    secure, no security system is impenetrable and, due to the
                    inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that
                    information, during transmission through the Internet or
                    while stored on our systems or otherwise, will be absolutely
                    safe from unauthorized access by others. Your payments are
                    handled over an encrypted connection or via a secure third
                    party processor. Access to personal information on our
                    databases is restricted to authorized staff. As appropriate,
                    we require our service providers with access to personal
                    information to sign agreements that require them to take
                    steps to protect the information.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you require help with using the Merchi service, our
                    support team may ask you to confirm some of your private
                    information, such as your name, delivery address, or other
                    relevant identifying information. Merchi will never email
                    you directly and ask for these details unless you have
                    requested help or support.

                  <p>
                    Our services are hosted in the United States. If you choose
                    to use the services from the European Union or other regions
                    of the world with laws governing data collection and use
                    that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are
                    transferring your information outside of those regions to
                    the United States for storage and processing. By providing
                    your information, you consent to any transfer and processing
                    in accordance with the policy.

                    Our website and services are not directed to individuals
                    under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal

                    we will take steps to delete such information. If you become
                    aware that a child has provided us with personal
                    information, please contact us.
